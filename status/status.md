Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I mapped out all of the HTML pages, functions, and SQL files I want to include in my project and started implementing some of them.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Written out a lot of programs (10% complete), error checked the entire site, asked other debaters what features they want.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I don't know how to get a dynamic schedule to show up on the website! I also am not sure how to get file exchange (I can just use drive links) or
a live chat with a coach/trade partner. All of these are not essential features, but would make the site functionality a lot cooler!
